üöÄ Hybrid Auto Encoder-Isolation Forest Model for Anomaly Detection in Transportation Systems
This repository contains the code and resources for my research project on developing a hybrid anomaly detection model for complex transportation systems. The model combines Auto Encoders and Isolation Forests to detect anomalies in real-time, ensuring operational security and system reliability.

üîç Project Overview
As transportation systems become increasingly interconnected, detecting anomalies like technical malfunctions, security breaches, and unexpected disruptions is crucial. Traditional anomaly detection methods struggle to keep up with these dynamic environments, which is why I designed a hybrid model that leverages machine learning techniques to enhance accuracy and adaptability.

Key Features:
Auto Encoder for anomaly reconstruction: Learns and models normal behavior patterns.
Isolation Forest for outlier detection: Efficiently identifies deviations from normal patterns.
Hybrid Approach: Combines the strengths of both methods to create a robust anomaly detection system that can handle a variety of disruptions in transportation data.
